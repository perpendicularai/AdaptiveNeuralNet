# AdaptiveNeuralNet
If you're a neuro-scientist you may already be aware of neurogensis in the brain. This is a repo that lends strongly from the concept of neurogenesis whereby it expands as amount of samples or inputs increase.

## Output
The output of the neural net is stored as csv files in the amount of per iterations per file, which is 5 although can vary depending on your neural network configuration.

## How to
1 - Run the `adaptive_neural_net.py` script to get started
2 - You may configure the `neural_net_viz.py` to visualize any of the output iteration samples.
